Implement several notions based on the archetype of Parametric Petri Nets introduced during my PhD.

- <a href="https://github.com/videlec/pplpy">PyPPL</a>


Execution
----------

  1. Install PyPPL 0.6.0
  2. In the main repository run : python main.py 

About the Code
--------------

The main functionalities are tested (creation of a net, execution of the net, find the subclass, Coverability tree, export of the net...). All the intermediate results are displayed in the terminal. 
The output generated correspond to:
  - nets created exported in .dot files
  - .png depicting those nets
  - .png depicting the coverability tree
